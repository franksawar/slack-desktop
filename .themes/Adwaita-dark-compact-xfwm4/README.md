# adwaita-dark-compact-xfwm4

I've made [an XFWM4 theme](https://gitlab.com/amitkul2/adwaita-dark-xfwm4/) that looks consistent with Adwaita-dark GTK+ theme (v3.30). This is the compact variant of it, where the titlebar size for GTK2 apps is reduced. 

Feel free to suggest any improvements and tweak it to your liking!
